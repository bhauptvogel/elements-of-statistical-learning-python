# My Journey Learning and Understanding the Elements of Statistical Learning with Python Jupyter Notebooks

This project documents my journey learning the concepts from "The Elements of Statistical Learning" book with Python and Jupyter notebooks. The project only uses NumPy, pandas and Matplotlib to learn the underlying concepts rather than applying them with modern frameworks.

The book "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman can be found [here](https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/ESLII.pdf).
